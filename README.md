# library R4



## Features

* Webpack based.
* ES6 as a source.
* Exports in a [umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) format so your library works everywhere.
* ES6 test setup with [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/).
* Linting with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).

## Process

```

* `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a watcher
* `npm run test` - well ... it runs the tests :)
